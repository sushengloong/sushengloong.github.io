## About codessl.com

I blog about software development, functional programming and machine learning.

If it is not obvious already, `ssl` is my initial and is neither Secure Socket Layer nor Self-Supervised Learning.

## About Sheng-Loong Su

I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at a very early stage stealth fintech startup.
As part of the founding team, I enjoy building products and services using pure functional programming with Scala and the Typelevel stack (Cats, Cats Effect, fs2, http4s, etc.)

Prior to joining the startup, I worked at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) and [GovTech Singapore](https://tech.gov.sg) where I did full stack development and data engineering with machine learning.

I lived and worked in San Francisco for a while. I moved back to Singapore in early 2020 (almost before COVID outbreak in Singapore and USA).
