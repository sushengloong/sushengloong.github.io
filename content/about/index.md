## About Sheng-Loong Su

I am currently doing software engineering at a fintech startup, [Smartpay](https://smartpay.co).
As part of the founding team, I enjoy building products and services using
pure functional programming with Scala and
the Typelevel stack (cats, cats effect, fs2, http4s, monocle, skunk, etc.)

Prior to joining the startup,
I was fortunate enough to work at
[Stripe](https://stripe.com),
[Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) and
[GovTech Singapore](https://tech.gov.sg)
where I did full stack, AI and data science engineering.

When I started this blog, I was living and working in San Francisco.
Currently, I am back in Singapore enjoying my favorite local food.
