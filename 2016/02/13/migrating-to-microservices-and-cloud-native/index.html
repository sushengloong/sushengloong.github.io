  <h1 class="post-title">Migrating to Microservices and Cloud Native</h1>
  <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2016</span>
  <p>“Microservices” is yet another buzzword in the modern application development scene.
I always heard and read about it but had never actually implemented a non-trivial production system using Microservices architecture.</p>

<p>Last week, thanks to my employer - IDA, I attended a 2-day Microservices workshop titled “Migrating a Monolith Application to Cloud Native” conducted by <a href="http://pivotal.io">Pivotal</a>.</p>

<h2 id="migrating-a-monolith-application-to-cloud-native">Migrating a Monolith Application to Cloud Native</h2>
<p>You might have noticed that “Microservices” is never mentioned in the workshop title.
I believe that is Pivotal’s branding strategy to push for their “Cloud Native” offering - “Spring Boot” + “Cloud Foundry”.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the cool thing is the materials of the entire workshop can be found on GitHub at the following link.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/S2EDU/MigratingAMonolithApplicationToCloudNative/blob/master/student_guide.adoc">https://github.com/S2EDU/MigratingAMonolithApplicationToCloudNative/blob/master/student_guide.adoc</a></p>

<p>This page consists of links to all the slides and hands-on lab exercises.</p>

<p>The following summarises what I learned throughout the workshop.</p>

<h2 id="spring-boot">Spring Boot</h2>
<p>Spring Boot is Pivotal’s attempt to simplify Java app development by favoring convention over configuration.
This is achieved mostly by adding a few Maven dependencies and annotating Java classes.
If I had to develop a Java web app, I would consider Spring Boot.
However, I still feel more comfortable with Ruby on Rails.</p>

<h2 id="cloud-foundry">Cloud Foundry</h2>
<p>Cloud Foundry is Pivotal’s Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), akin to Heroku, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk and Red Hat Openshift.
We operate on Cloud Foundry using Pivotal Web Console as well as the command line interface tool.
In particular, the command line tool makes application deployment as easy as running <code class="highlighter-rouge">cf push</code> from the terminal.
Furthermore, Cloud Foundry’s Marketplace offers a wide range of services such as MySQL, MongoDB, Memcached, Message Queues, Redis, etc.</p>

<h2 id="shift-in-paradigm">Shift in Paradigm</h2>
<p>In the past, developers needed to make decision on the underlying hardware and then virtual machines.
Recently, container technology such as Docker has become prevailing but still does not solve the problem of managing large number of containers.
PaaS addresses this pain point by allowing developers to focus on only Application and Data.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-microservices">What is Microservices?</h3>
<p>My understanding of microservices is an architectural style where the system is composed of a suite of small independent and autonomous services.</p>

<h3 id="microservices-vs-soa">Microservices vs SOA</h3>
<p>Microservices is similar to Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) except that:-</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is not used</li>
  <li>Communication pipeline is lightweight and dumb, eg. REST and AMQP</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-to-split-a-monolith-into-microservices">How to split a Monolith into Microservices?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Based on functionality and data relationship (boundary)</li>
  <li>Based on persistence storage (RDBMS vs Graph Database)</li>
  <li>Based on business value</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="standalone-server-vs-embedded-server">Standalone Server vs Embedded Server</h3>
<p>In the past, developers tended to deploy multiple application WAR/EAR into a server container, eg. Tomcat, WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, etc.</p>

<p>With microservices, it is usually the other way round where each application will launch its own embedded server, eg. Embedded Tomcat, Jetty, etc.
The benefit is each application server is independent of others.</p>
