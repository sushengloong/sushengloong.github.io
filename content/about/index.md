## About codessl.com

This is my personal website and blog where I write about software development and machine learning.

The reason why I picked `codessl.com` as the domain name is because `ssl` is my initial -- `Su Sheng Loong` is the full name I normally use in Singapore.

## About Sheng-Loong Su

By day, I am a Senior Software Engineer at Salesforce where I do full-stack, backend and data engineering in mostly Scala.

By night, I study and practise machine learning. I am particularly interested in deep learning.

Currently I live in San Francisco, California, United States of America.
