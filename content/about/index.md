## About Sheng-Loong Su

I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at a startup, [Smartpay](https://smartpay.co).
As part of the founding team, I enjoy building products and services using pure functional programming with Scala and the Typelevel stack (Cats, Cats Effect, fs2, http4s, etc.)

Prior to joining the startup, I worked at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) and [GovTech Singapore](https://tech.gov.sg) where I did full stack development and AI/data science engineering.

I lived and worked in San Francisco for a while. I am currently back in Singapore.
